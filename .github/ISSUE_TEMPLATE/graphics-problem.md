<!--
Following items are basic test, please do before creating issue.
1. Did you test with vanilla profile? If problem occurs, then your machine is in some trouble.
2. Did you test with only forge? If problem occurs, then your forge installation may be broken.
3. Did you test entire modpack, without optimization mod (likely OptiFine)? If problem occurs, then your optimization may be incompatible with this pack or your machine.
